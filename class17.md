* [What is Mitre’s ATT&CK framework? What red teams need to know](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3267691/what-is-mitres-attandck-framework-what-red-teams-need-to-know.html)

### The ATT&CK Framework
Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge

Developed in 2013, it began as an internal project and became a "behemoth of a public knowledge base that numerous security vendors and consultants have picked up."  

> "The goal of the Mitre researchers is to break down and classify attacks in a consistent and clear manner that can make it easier to compare and contrast them to find how the attacker exploited your networks and endpoints and penetrated your network."

You have to right team *and* you have to get the right collection of tools to understand your potential thread vectores. A few choices:
* Build your own red-team-style attack tools
* Hire a managed security service provider (MSSP) or consultant to monitor your network and defenses
* Assemble a collection of various paid and open source techniques for internal use

As threat actors gain more skill, defenders have to "up their game, too." When you gather and compare data, you can identify patterns, trends, and evolution.  ATT&CK has five threat matrices...

1. A “pre-attack” collection of 17 different categories that help to prevent an attack before the adversary has a chance to get inside your network
2. Windows endpoint considerations
3. Mac endpoint considerations
4. Linux endpoint considerations
5. Mobile-based attacks
