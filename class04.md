# Day 4 - Identity and Access Management

* [What is IAM? Identity and access management explained](https://www.csoonline.com/article/2120384/what-is-iam-identity-and-access-management-explained.html)

> "The core objective of IAM systems is one digital identity per individual. Once that digital identity has been established, it must be maintained, modified and monitored throughout each user’s “access lifecycle.” 

### IAM tools
* **API security**
* **Customer identity and access management (CIAM)**
* **Identity analytics (IA)**
* **Identity as a service (IDaaS)**
* **Identity management and governance (IMG)**
* **Risk-based authentication (RBA)**

IAM systems have to be flexible in today's modern workspaces... they used to be the providers of a "fence" around the perimeter, when people were working on premises. With the increasingly remote nature of work, this is no longer true or possible.

"Identity management systems today should enable administrators to easily manage access privileges for a variety of users, including domestic on-site employees and international off-site contractors; hybrid compute environments that encompass on-premise computing, software as a service (SaaS) applications and shadow IT and BYOD users; and computing architectures that include UNIX, Windows, Macintosh, iOS, Android and even internet of things (IoT) devices."

***GDPR**-(General Data Protection Regulation) requires strong security and user access controls in the EU (or for companies with customers in the EU.)

In 2017, the state of New York's new requirement went into effect, with requirements for financial services companies that included monitoring activities of authorized users and maintaining audit logs.
