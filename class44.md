# Day 44 - Exploitation with Metasploit
12/4/20

* [What is Metasploit?](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3379117/what-is-metasploit-and-how-to-use-this-popular-hacking-tool.html)

Metasploit comes with Kali Linux and is a penetration testing framework that "makes hacking simple." "Pretty much every reconnaissance tool you can think of integrates with Metasploit, making it possible to find the chink in the armor you're looking for."

It has a very modular framework to help pentesters with a myriad of projects and objectives, but it's also 'tweakable' so you can adjust it and tinker with it to your heart's content, tailoring it exactly to your needs and specifications.

The best way to learn Metasploit is to download and install Kali Linux and a 'vunerable' virtual machine for target practice. There's also Metasploit Unleashed (a free training course), a youtube channel, and more for beginning pentesters.

"Like Coca-Cola, Metasploit comes in different flavors."
