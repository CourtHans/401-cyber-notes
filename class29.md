[What Is Threat Hunting and Why Is It so Important? â€“ Video Blog](https://www.activecountermeasures.com/what-is-threat-hunting-and-why-is-it-so-important-video-blog/)

**Quick definition:**</br>
Threat hunting is a active/proactive activity and the output is a compromise assessment. This is **not** forensics.

E.g. "going in to see are any of our internal systems, not just desktops, but everything, any of our internal systems showing signs of being compromised."

"Threat hunting should reduce the gap between protection failure and response as much as possible." There are two categories: Protection or Response.

On avg, 191 days to ID a breach & 66 days to contain it - ***this is a problem***. Often, it's not even our logging system, but a 3rd party that tells us (like law enforcement that found your info on the dark web).
