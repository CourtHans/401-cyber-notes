# Day 7 - Protecting Data at Rest
10/13/20

* [Data Protection: Data In transit vs. Data At Rest](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/data-protection-data-in-transit-vs-data-at-rest)

> "Protecting sensitive data both in transit and at rest is imperative for modern enterprises as attackers find increasingly innovative ways to compromise systems and steal data."

"While data at rest is sometimes considered to be less vulnerable than data in transit, attackers often find data at rest a more valuable target than data in motion."

Unprotected data leaves enterprises at risk, no matter where that data is. One of the most effective ways to protect it is through encryption. However, you should also:
* Implement robust network security controls
* Use proactive security measures
* Choose solutions that enable user input/interactivity
* Create policies for systematically categorizing and classifying all company data

"***Who has access to your data, how is it encrypted, and how often your data is backed up are all imperative questions to ask.***"
