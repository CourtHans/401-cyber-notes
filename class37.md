* [5 Python Libraries Every Pentester Should Be Using](https://www.nopsec.com/5-python-libraries-every-pentester-should-be-using/)

1. Impacket
2. Python Nmap (libnmap)
3. Scapy/dpkt+pcapy
4. Requests/BeautifulSoup
5. Mona</br>
**Bonus:** Socket

**Impacket**</br>
Works with network protocols and provides low-level programmatic access to the packets, and for some protocols, the entire implementation.

**Python Nmap**</br>
Makes it easier to parse Nmap scan results!

**Scapy**
Programmatically accomplished the functionality of tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, hping, arpspoof, tcpdump, etc.

**Requests/BeautifulSoup**
Perfect for generating custom payloads and attacks against web applications, it can also isolate details in HTTP requests.

**Mona**
Identifies offsets, bad characters, ROP gadgets, and generates functional exploit code.

**Socket**
More or less anything that communicates over a network interface uses this library, it's the building block all the rest stand upon!
