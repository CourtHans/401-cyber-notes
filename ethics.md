# Ethics in Tech

* [The code Iâ€™m still ashamed of](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e/)

What struck me about this article is how easy it is to find yourself in a situation like that... Oh, "This is what my boss asked for," or "This is what the client wants" - it's not my decision, I'm just doing what I'm told like a good little worker. But it's incredibly important - critical - for us to bring our whole selves to work, ethics and all. I think about whistle-blowers at Enron, or in the government, and I think about the times I've played along with the "management line" - and when I've explicitly spoken out against it. One of my proudest accomplishments was speaking out against a "just accept it" sort of policy I knew to be both morally wrong and - ultimately - illegal. It took me a long time, but I finally found my voice and was no longer afraid to use my privilege to speak out against immoral or unethical practices or behaviors, be they illegal or "mildly misogynistic."

As a developer or security professional, we have a responsibility to bring our ethics into the operations and safeguards of society, to know better and to do better.

[Will democracy survive big data and AI?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/will-democracy-survive-big-data-and-artificial-intelligence/)

"Programmed society, programmed citizens." This article was written in 2017 but - on the heels of the 2020 election it feels like it barely scratched the surface of the effects we're already feeling about Big Data. I can't help but think of Cambridge Analytica and the data warfare being waged by political campaigns and foreign states to influence election outcome - "persuasive computing" I believe is what this article refers to. It's "nice" to have a 'tailor-made' web experience - being served up things that align with our interest and feel like serendipitous discovery. However, it's incredibly dangerous for a free-thinking society. It's becoming increasingly clear that many (most? all?) are unwittingly trapped in our own echo chambers of opinion and even facts. "In this way, personalized information can unintentionally destroy social cohesion." Case in point, 2020.

I appreciated that the article pointed out that "even benevolent decision-makers may do more wrong than right" as 'nudging' exploits psychological weakness for stronger party gain.
