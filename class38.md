# Day 36 - Vulnerability Scanning with Nessus
11/25/20

* [Vulnerability Scanning VS Penetration Testing](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/vulnerability-management/difference-vulnerability-scanning-penetration-testing/)

> "Vulnerability scanning cannot replace the importance of penetration testing, and penetration testing, on its own, cannot secure the entire network."

Penetration testing is a human endeavor, though vulnerability scanning can be automated (however, still has an important human factor). Penetration testing is a time-boxed endeavor, has a high chance of causing an outtage, and looks to exploit and report upon undetected vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scanning, however, is continuous, ongoing, and merely exposes weakness, as opposed to exploiting it.

"The Center for Internet Security (CIS) Control #3, “Continuous Vulnerability Management,” calls on security practitioners to 'Continuously acquire, assess, and take action on new information in order to identify vulnerabilities, remediate, and minimize the window of opportunity for attackers.'"
