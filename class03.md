> "Risk management audits force us to be vulnerable, exposing all our systems and strategies. They’re uncomfortable, but they’re undeniably worth it."

The main purpose of a security audit is to tease out an organization's vulnerabilities before a malicious actor does. They can be conducted by internal or external auditors, and can be done manually, automated, or a mix of both methods. At a bare minimum, you should conduct a full audit *at least* once a year. 

**Common IT Security Audit Standards**</br>
* ISO Compliance (The International Organization for Standardization)
* HIPAA Security Rule
* PCI DSS Compliance
* SOX Compliance (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) 

**Best Practices**</br>
- Establish a baseline of normal operations
- Practice Preparedness
- Make it a team effort

### Security Audit Checklist
1. "Record all audit details, including who’s performing the audit and what network is being audited, so you have these details on hand.
2. Document all current security policies and procedures for easy access.
3. Evaluate activity logs to determine if all IT staff have performed the necessary safety policies and procedures.
4. Identify which employees have been trained to identify security threats, and which still require training.
5. Analyze your security patches to ensure everything is up to date.
6. Conduct a self-test on your existing software to identify any vulnerabilities.
7. Search for any holes within your existing firewall.
8. Double-check exactly who has access to sensitive data and where said data is stored within your network.
9. Implement all encryption best practices where appropriate.
10. Verify the security of every one of your wireless networks.
11. Conduct a scan to identify every network access point.
12. Regularly review event logs to keep human error at a minimum."

## Security audits

1) Ask yourself, is everything running to policy?
2) Make sure the routine is scheduled
3) Consider a tool for log analysis (take out human error, automate what you can)

Consider privilege auditing (does everyone have correct permissions and *only* what they need?), usage auditing (are they using tech in the proper way?), escalation auditing (procedures and readiness), and administrative auditing (document, document, document).
